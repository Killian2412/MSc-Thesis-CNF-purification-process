# CNF-purification-process
This Github page concerns the design and simulation of a process plant for the purification of CMP-produced Carbon nanofibers. The relevant AspenPlus V12 and Python files for the simulation, techno-economic analysis and sensitivity analysis of the process plant can be accessed on this page. Furthermore, the Python code for curve fitting of the acid leaching kinetics of nickel from CNF is provided.
